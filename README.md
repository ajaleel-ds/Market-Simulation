# Market-Simulation
For this project we produce a market simulator that accepts trading orders and keeps track of a portfolioâ€™s performance over time. Furthermore, to make the simulation more realistic there is a cost for every entry and exit transaction to and from the market. A 0.5% was set as a default transaction cost. Lastly, a fixed comission rate of $9.95 was applied to every entry and exit transaction. A visual representaion of the portfolios performance is provided for every order set.
